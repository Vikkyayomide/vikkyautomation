### 👩🏽‍💻 About Me

I am a learner of the **ALX Software Engineering Program**, currently diving deep into **backend development**.

This is why I started this journey:
> 🧠 I’ve always been fascinated by how websites and apps actually *work* — the behind-the-scenes logic that connects users, servers, and data. That curiosity led me here, and now I’m committed to building smart, automated, and useful backend systems.

---

### 🎯 My Vision

My aim is to become a **skilled backend engineer**, create tools that **automate real-world processes**, and eventually build **products and platforms that scale globally**, starting from Nigeria and beyond.

### 💼 Projects I’d Love to Work On

- 🏦 Fintech apps (e.g. payment platforms, savings trackers)
- 🧾 Invoice generators or inventory systems for small businesses
- 📦 API-based tools (e.g. booking systems, automation dashboards)
- 🔐 Secure authentication and user management systems
- 🤖 No-code/low-code backend integrations

### 🌱 What I'm Currently Working On

### 🧩 Fun Facts

- I love learning by doing — my projects are my playground!
- I’m passionate about automation, backend logic, and systems that just **work quietly and perfectly** in the background.
- My dream is to build **impactful platforms** that create jobs, save time, and solve real problems.
